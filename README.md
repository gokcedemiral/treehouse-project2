# treehouse-project2
Team Treehouse 2nd Project on Adding Pagination and listing.

# Project Description

A student list containing names, photos and email addresses are given. By using JS you are expected to display 10 names at a time and provide a navigation system, aka a pagination, to reach the next 10 of the list and so on. 

- You are expected to adhere "Progressive enhancement principles". Meaning, once the JS is turned off, the page should continue displaying the list as a whole, and/or the basic content, functionality, message, look and feel should be accessible to all web browsers/ different display resolutions.

- You are expected to use vanilla JS.

- You are expected to link all JS from an external file rather than inline JS and use unobstrusive JS.

- Always explain how the functions work with code comments.

- Paging, pagination links and search bar needs to be written as "DRY" as possible.
